How to Run:
- You can just run the code.
- I attached py and ipynb(colab) because I write the code through 'colab'. 
- You can change the activation, learn_rate, iteration in the main function

Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing, neural_network, metrics sklearn.model_selection)
- tensorflow
